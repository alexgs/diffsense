# DiffSense

_See [NEXT](NEXT.md) to get back up to speed quickly when returning to this project._

DiffSense is a modular, open-source benchmark for evaluating large language models on real-world software engineering tasks. It provides a pluggable harness, reusable scoring plugins, and discoverable public and private scenario packs, making it easy to run consistent tests across different models and providers. Results can be published as static artifacts for full transparency, with optional private datasets supported for sensitive evaluations.
